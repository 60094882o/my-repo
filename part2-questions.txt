Answer the following, add your answer below each question:

1- Open the file quiz.html in your browser and play with the game to test it. Currently, the game has a bug. Although it correctly validates answers to addition questions, it incorrectly validates answers to multiplication questions, i.e., it gives the wrong feedback. Find the commit that introduced this bug, copy and paste its ID below.

commit 817d51ac7e48e51a84f9badeb8e9626c2b1cb1cf

2- Don't fix the bug now, but create another branch named 'subtract' and switch to this branch. Modify the game so that it asks the user to answer subtraction questions in addition to the multiplication and the sum questions implemented before (the operation must be chosen randomly). You have to make at least one commit while you are implementing this functionality, but again, without fixing the bug above. Copy and paste the ID of each commit you made below.

commit 57ea6853c62a093beb48ff9b84f531ff6592d606

3- Push the changes you made on this branch to the remote.

4- Switch back to the master branch, fix the bug that you found above in a new commit and paste its ID below.

commit d908aa566b8d31ed2bbb245cad9d96da2e32ea6a

5- Merge the subtract branch into the master and resolve any conflicts you get. Then push your changes to the remote.

6- Remember to save this file, add and commit it, then push again.
